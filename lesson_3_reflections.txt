// When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'll use it immediately so I can switch computers to work in different environments, but it would obviously also be useful for collaboration. 

// What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I'm less likely to be far off of any changes being made remotely and will have less work to do if I have to merge remote changes.
