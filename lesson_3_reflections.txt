// When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'll use it immediately so I can switch computers to work in different environments, but it would obviously also be useful for collaboration.

// Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone might make changes remotely that I don't like.

// Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch might be for working on a new feature or version (like adding a language, say) that could be merged back; a clone is a fully separate version of a project; a fork is a fully separate version that points back to an original version, possibly by someone else.

// What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I'm less likely to be far off of any changes being made remotely and will have less work to do if I have to merge remote changes.

// How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I could send files via Dropbox or a similar service, but the documentation would be a bit more involved, and changes would be much harder to keep track of.

// When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I might make changes in a separate branch when I'm working on a new feature that isn't ready for prime-time yet -- or something that could ultimately be a completely and permanently separate version of a product, say in a different language or with a different purpose.
