// What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git init initializes a new repository, adding a .git file that will hold metadata about future commits. 

// How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the group of files chosen to be included in the next commit -- and is not necessarily every file in the working directory. It can save time uploading and downloading as well as simplifying searches for changes in the future.
